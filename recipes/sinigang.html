        <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>Pork Sinigang or Sinigang na Baboy is a sour soup native to the Philippines. This particular soup dish uses pork as the main ingredient though beef, shrimp, fish, and even chicken (this is known as sinampalukang manok) can be used. Bony parts of the pig known as “buto-buto” are usually preferred for this dish. These parts can be either of the following: pork neck bone, chopped spare ribs, chopped baby back ribs, and pork belly. Sometimes pork kasim and pigue (pork ham) are also used.</p>
            <p>There are several ingredients that can be used as souring agent. The most common and widely used is the tamarind fruit (known as sampaloc). Other fruits such as guava, tomato, bilimbi (known as kamias), green mango, pineapple, and wild mangosteen (santol) can also be used to make the sinigang taste sour.</p>
